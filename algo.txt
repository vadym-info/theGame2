main
-create quess manager
-get number of player, 2-8
-create player info list
-pass player list into quess manager
-get name and type for every player
-create player info
-create player based on type and name
-generate real weight
-pass real weight to quess manager
-output real weight
-:start the game


quess manager
-store real weight
-store all quesses list
-contains queue of players
-add quess request. if is not processing then call process the quess
-process the quess
:start the game
-start timer for 1500 milliseconds. when it overs then :game ends lose
-use initial player list as firts queue of players
-start processing the guesses


:process the guess
-set is processing to true
-for every player call get guess
-for cheater player call get guess until all quesses list does not contain the quess
-compare the guess with real weight
:win
-:game ends win
:wrong
-save the guess in player info (list of quesses)
-save the quess in all quesses list (need that value for cheater players). check if the guess already exist before add
-increment number of attempts in player info
-if number of attempts ==100 :game ends lose
-compute delta and sleep player for that milliseconds
-set is processing to false

:game ends win
-stop processing guesses
-output player name
-output total number of attempts (length of all quesses list)


:game ends lose
-stop processing guesses
-find closest guess in all quesses list
-output the closest guess value
-output player name of the closest guess


player
-name
-list of guesses
-get guess
-wait


cheater


player info
-contains player
-contains list of guesses
-contains number of attempts. maybe length of all guesses. when ==100 game ends
?contains thread for every player
